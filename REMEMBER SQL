DISTINCT:

DISTINCT is used to return unique values in the output. It filters out all duplicate values in the specified column(s).


Where:
We can restrict our query results using the WHERE clause in order to obtain only the information we want.

AS:

AS is a keyword in SQL that allows you to rename a column or table using an alias. 
Example: 
The new name can be anything you want as long as you put it inside of single quotes. Here we renamed the name column as Titles.
Knowing how SELECT works, suppose we have the code below:

SELECT name AS 'Titles'
FROM movies;
